# Verilog-Implementation-Computer-Architecture
Verilog Implementation of MIPS Single Architecture , BTA and MCU Unit.

# Directory Structure
  `MIPS Single` Folder consist of verilog files for each unit seperatly and mips32.v that connects all these units.

  `BTA` consist of report and BTA.v verilog file.
  
  `MCU` consist of report and code details in it.
  
# Running the Code

1. Import the folder in Xilinx or similar verilog software.
2. Build the project.
